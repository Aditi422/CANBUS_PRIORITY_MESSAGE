# CANBUS_PRIORITY_MESSAGE
Controller Area Network (CAN) is a robust and widely used. In this process I am focusing on message  prioritization which means When a CAN device transmits data onto the network, an identifier that is unique throughout the network precedes the data.The output effectively demonstrates the concurrent execution of threads, potential race conditions (shared variable updates), and the handling of messages by different nodes in a simulated CAN system.
