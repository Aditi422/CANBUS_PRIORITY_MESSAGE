# CANBUS_PRIORITY_MESSAGE
Controller Area Network (CAN) is a robust and widely used. In this process I am focusing on message  prioritization which means When a CAN device transmits data onto the network, an identifier that is unique throughout the network precedes the data. The identifier defines not only the content of the data, but also the priority of the messages.
